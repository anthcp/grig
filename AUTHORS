Grig is designed and developed by Alexandru Csete, OZ9AEC.

Joop Stakenborg, PG4I, provided debian packages under debian/testing. He has
also done a lots of testing and fixed some bugs.

Pierre-Philippe Coupard, F8EJF, should be credited for the s-meter pixmap which
has been taken from his very nice CWirc program.

Release 0.8.0 has been made by Stephane Fillod, F8CFE, and Nirgal Vourgere.
It may be one of the last version before architectural changes, and an eventual
rewrite into Python.

Also thanks to the many people around who have tested grig, reported bugs and
helped fixing them.
